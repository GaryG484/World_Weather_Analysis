# World_Weather_Analysis

##### Utilizing google maps this project was to create an app that asked for a preferred temperature range that a customer would want to vacation in.  It would then take the temperature input and generate a list of 2000 cities with a latitude and longitude that would fall into that temperature range.  It also searches and displays hotels and current weather data for those cities. It then allows you to choose a route that you would like to vacation through.
